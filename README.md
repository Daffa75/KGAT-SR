KGAT-SR
======
Hi! You are welcome to visit here!<br>
This repository is used to release the code of KGAT-SR, a newly proposed model for session-based recommendation by our research team. **KGAT-SR** stands for the **Knowledge-Enhanced Graph Attention Network for Session-based Recommendation**, which uses the knowledge about items from a KG to enhance session embedding via graph attention networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first session-based recommendation model that exploits external knowledge to enhance session embedding via graph attention networks. The research paper of KGAT-SR has been published in the 2021 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI), which is available at: https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI52525.2021.00164. The citation format in the IEEE Style is as follows:
